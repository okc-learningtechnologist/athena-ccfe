# ATHENA PROJECT

> A front-end intended to be a complete course catalog for instructor-led and distance learning delivery methods.

## Mission

This is a front-end intended to be a refactor and complete replacement for the current Course Catalog.  It will also incorporate functions of a Learning Management System (LMS) / Learning Record Store (LRS) and quota control tools. Prometheus project will be the keeper of the knowledge but this front end will be responsible for displaying it to the 'user'.
